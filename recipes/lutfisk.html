        <p>This is a Scandinavian dish. Lutefisk is cod that was was traditionally dried for storage through the winter. Then when it was time to use it, it was soaked in a mixture of lye and water which rehydrated and softened it. The texture is like Jell-O® and will fall apart easily so it needs to be handled carefully. It is an odd food for sure, fish-flavored Jell-O®, so don't be too critical. Some people love it, others will hate it. This is just the best way I have found to prepare it.</p>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dried lutfisk</li>
        <li>1 quart water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
<h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring water and salt to a rolling boil. Add lutefisk and return to a boil. Remove from the heat, cover, and let sit for 8 minutes. Check with an instant-read thermometer to make sure the internal temperature has reached 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Carefully remove lutefisk from water using a scoop strainer or skimmer spoon. Cover with melted butter and serve immediately.</li>
      
    </ol>

    <p>If you like a salty flavor you can use up to 3 tablespoons salt per quart of water, but I don't care for that much.</p>
    <p>If you are cooking 6 or more servings you can use less water and salt, just keep the ratio of water to salt the same. The timing is important because you want to serve this fish as soon as it is ready.</p>
