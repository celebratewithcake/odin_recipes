        <p>These cranberry pistachio cookies studded with red and green colors make great Christmas cookies. I have used other nuts instead of pistachios with success.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Prep Time: 25 minutes</li>
        <li>Cook Time: 45 minutes</li>
        <li>Additional Time: 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Total Time: 1 hour 20 minutes</li>

    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup light olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups pistachio nuts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dried cranberries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Mix together sugar and oil in a large bowl until well blended. Mix in vanilla and almond extracts, then beat in eggs. Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; gradually stir into egg mixture until combined. Fold in pistachios and cranberries by hand.</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Form each piece into a 12x2-inch log on the prepared cookie sheet. Dough may be sticky; wet hands with cool water to handle dough more easily.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until logs are light brown, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce oven temperature to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut logs on the diagonal into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Lay cookies cut-side down on the cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies until dry, 8 to 10 minutes</li>
    </ol>

    <t2><em>Tip:</em></t2>

    <p>If your pistachios are salted, omit the 1/4 teaspoon salt from the recipe.</p>
